# GAN - Theory and Applications

The file `slides/slides.pdf` can be visualized correctly using [pdfpc](https://pdfpc.github.io/) by running the command:

```bash
pdfpc slides/slides.pdf --disable-auto-grouping
```

The file `slides/slides-adobe.pdf` can be visualized correctly using Adobe Reader.

In alternative you can just use your pdf reader but animations may not run properly.

The notebook `1. GAN - theory and applications` contains the transcription of the slides for the theory part.
